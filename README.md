# Front-End

Proposal

- What problem does your app solve? 

        This app allows school administrators in the developing world to track and broadcast the needs of their school to board members in the US. Once the board members in the US have the requests they can take care of them and mark them as done, scheduled, etc.


- Be as specific as possible; how does your app solve the problem?

        School Admin can login and create, read, update and delete information on the condition of the school including general issues and the condition of equipment devices in the school (TVs, tablets, chromebooks, servers, routers, HDMI cables, etc). 

- What is the mission statement?
    
        Supportify enables administrators to simply keep track of assets, manage inventory and share the needs of their school.

Frameworks - Libraries

- What 3rd party frameworks/libraries are you considering using?
        - Redux, React-router, react-router-dom, node, express, styled-components

- Do APIs require you to contact its maintainer to gain access? 
    No

- Are you required to pay to use the API? 
    No

- Have you considered using Apple Frameworks? (MapKit, Healthkit, ARKit?)
    No


For Data Scientists

- Describe the Established data source with at least rough data able to be provided on day 1. 
- You can gather information about the data set you’ll be working with from the project description. Be sure to collaborate with your PM, and your Backend Architect to chat about the resources you have.
- Write a description for what the DS problem is (what uncertainty/prediction are we trying to do here? Sentiment analysis? Why is this a useful solution to a problem?)
- A target (e.g. JSON format or such) for output that DS students can deliver to web/other students for them to ingest and use in the app

Target Audience

- Who is your target audience? Be specific.

        Administrative staff
        Education Services
    

- What feedback have you gotten from potential users?

        No

- Have you validated the problem and your solution with your target audience? How?

        NA

Research

- Research thoroughly before writing a single line of code. Solidify the features of your app conceptually before implementation. Spend the weekend researching so you can hit the ground running on Monday.

        NA





Prototype Key Feature(s)

- This is the “bread and butter” of the app, this is what makes your app yours. Calculate how long it takes to implement these features and triple the time estimated. That way you’ll have plenty of time to finish. It is preferred to drop features and spend more time working on your MVP features if needed.

    
        Initial Deployment: EOD Monday
